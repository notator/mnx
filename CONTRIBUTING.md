# Contributing to the MNX repository

Here's a quick guide to our development process for folks who'd like to
contribute.

## GitHub Pages

The main purpose of this repository is to host the MNX specification(s)
and related documents. We use GitHub Pages for this; the fully rendered
specs live at [https://w3c.github.io/mnx/](https://w3c.github.io/mnx/).

That GitHub Pages site uses the content in our repo's `master` branch.

Please note that it takes GitHub Pages a few moments to update each
time `master` is updated.

## Issue reporting

Here's the general process of how we organize ideas, issues and pull
requests:

1. Anybody can raise an issue in
   [our issue tracker](https://github.com/w3c/mnx/issues/).
2. The group co-chairs discuss and triage the issue. If it's out of
   scope, it might get closed outright. Otherwise, it'll be assigned a
   milestone -- which essentially sets a priority for the issue. See
   the [list of milestones](https://github.com/w3c/mnx/milestones) for
   descriptions of their meanings. The most important one is "V1",
   which covers issues that *must* be addressed in the first version
   of the MNX spec.
3. We assign the "Active Review"
   [label](https://github.com/w3c/mnx/labels) to issues that the
   community group wants to resolve in the near future. This basically
   amounts to our near-term to-do list.

We welcome pull requests, but please note that each pull request should
have an associated issue in our issue tracker.
